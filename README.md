# dceMRI-Matab
Summary: A collection of general purpose utility functions written in MATLAB in 2014 (updated in Octave in 2025) as part of a software toolkit for analyzing dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dce-mri) data. The toolkit was designed to assess lung vascular properties and supports research into the effects of lipopycacridine, used as a human model of acute lung injury. The ultimate goal was to develop imaging biomarkers to inform and guide novel treatment strategies. For more information, please refer to the 'readme' folder.
